                We have a 4 step watertight R&D process. At step 1, we create design concepts based on customer requirements and briefs. Here simulations are used for feasibility analysis and design freeze.

After concept approvals, comes step 2 and 3 of product design and its optimization, wherein an in house experienced team of engineers specializing in multiple areas viz., Mechanics, Electrical, Electronic Components and Magnetism work on the concepts to create MVPs. Exceptional designing is an integral aspect of all Flash products. We have an in-house team of highly-trained product engineering designers having expertise in latest design softwares. Their extensive experience in designing of components, tools and assembly lines is critical to our efficient designs and engineering costs.

The final and crucial step of the process is the Validation Testing to ascertain expected design performance. Every product at Flash Electronics undergoes a series of validation tests in our in-house Endurance Laboratory. Quick validation for approving new designs and early implementation of VAVE(value analysis and value engineering) Ideas is seamlessly executed in this lab.
