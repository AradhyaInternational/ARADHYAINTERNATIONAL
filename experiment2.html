    </p style="color: black;"> The first, and most essential step for any component evaluation is visual inspection process. The procedure and
    acceptance standards have been developed in order to detect and report evidence of remarking, resurfacing, and
    refurbishing marking permanency. Resistance to solvents, resurfacing, dimension verification, marking code matching,
    high-power magnification inspection of body and terminal condition are standard methods within our inspection
    process. All inspections and observations are reviewed by Quality Engineers to evaluate whether we are seeing a new
    counterfeiting technique.
    A destructive test that removes the insulation material of the component to reveal the die. The die is then analyzed
    for markings and architecture to determine traceability and authenticity of the device, Magnification power of up to
    1,000x is necessary to identify die markings and surface anamolies. Qur decapsulation report includes analysis of
    the die markings and topography to clarify what is verified versus still unverified about a device. We do not only
    send images and leave the analysis up to you.
